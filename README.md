# Data Structures and Algorithms (In Progress)

> ### The course because of which this whole idea came up

## About the repository

This is a collection of all the Data Structures & Algorithms that are taught in the above-mentioned courses. I have
tried to practice all the things that are taught, and then I have tried to compile all of them in a documented manner. I
learned so many things even though I was familiar with the concepts but this course helped me think differently. This
course also helped me to understand the use of all the data structures and algorithms with the help of real-life
examples.
